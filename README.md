## Overview

Zeynep is a project that creates a decentralized NFT space for preserving and patent personal thoughts, memories, and ideas using Zircuit’s zero-knowledge rollup technology. Leverage account abstraction to enable gasless interactions, and integrate a quarantine layer to protect against spam and stealimg. This platform empowers creators to mint unique NFTs for their concepts (e.g., a movie idea) or shared memories (e.g., a story with a friend), allowing others to like, bid, or collaborate without traditional blockchain barriers.

## Features
- **NFT Minting for Thoughts & Memories**: Create NFTs for original ideas or shared experiences (e.g., a movie plot or a memory with a friend).
- **Scalability on Layer2**: All actions will take place on Layer2, providing low cost and high speed. In this way, the global user experience will be smoothly executed.
- **Account Abstraction for gassless UX**: Enable gasless likes and interactions using Zircuit’s account abstraction tech.
- **Protection with Zircuit Quarantine Layer**: Automatically quarantine and cancel suspicious transactions (e.g., spam or theft attempts) using Zircuit’s SLS.
- **Monetization**: Allow users to bid on or donate to NFTs, fostering a creator economy.
- **Privacy with ZK-Proofs**: Use Zircuit’s zero-knowledge proofs to protect sensitive content while proving ownership.

## How It Works
### 1. Minting an NFT
- A user inputs a thought (e.g., "Movie idea: Time-traveling chef") or memory (e.g., "Trip with friend X") via a simple interface.
- The content is minted as an NFT on Zircuit, linked to the creator’s wallet.
- Example: `nft.mint("Time-traveling chef", creatorAddress)`.

### 2. Account Abstraction
- Users can like or interact with NFTs without paying gas fees, thanks to Zircuit’s account abstraction.
- Transactions are batched, reducing costs for end-users.

### 3. Quarantine Mechanism
- Suspicious transactions (e.g., rapid minting or unauthorized access) are managed by Zircuit’s sequencer.
- Prove it is not the same person to deploy the ownership and cancel the tx 

### 4. Monetization & Collaboration
- Others can bid on NFTs (e.g., "Offer 0.1 ETH for movie idea") or donate.
- Creators and co-creators (e.g., friend X) split proceeds.
