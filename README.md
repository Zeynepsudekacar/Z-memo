**#Z-memo**

People say memories last forever, but they can fade over time. Blockchain gives us a way to make them last forever, like a digital safe. Why not use this to save the most important things in our minds and on the chain? Every memory belongs to the person who lived it, and that’s where NFTs come in—they give you ownership. **Just like every book has a cover, every memory gets its own NFT to show it’s yours and keeps it special.**

People scroll through social media and see only perfect lives, which makes them feel unhappy with their own. But real life isn’t like that—full of ups and downs. They need a place where they can read and connect with real stories. Z-memo is here to fill that gap.

You might wonder, **“Why would people care to read or support someone else’s memories?”** Here are strong reasons that make Z-memo special:

Empathy & Human CuriosityPeople are naturally curious about others’ lives, choices, and feelings. Unlike made-up stories, real memories show the raw, honest side of life. This gives readers a chance to:

**Feel empathy by connecting with someone else’s experience.**
Learn new perspectives or life lessons.
Find inspiration to handle their own emotions.

**Collecting Dimension (NFT Unique Selling Point)**
Mint memories as permanent NFTs on the blockchain. People can add:
-Memories that inspire them,
-Stories that touch their hearts,
-Shares that reflect their identity,
to their collections, showcasing personal value and identity—like collecting art or a signed book from a favorite author.


## Overview
Z-memo is a social hub built to share and preserve real memories. Using Zircuit’s technology, we let creators mint unique NFTs from their personal memories (like a special day with a friend or a tough moment overcome). Others can like, bid on, or collaborate on these memories without the usual blockchain hassles, thanks to Zircuit’s fast and scalable tech.


## Features
- **NFT Minting for Memories**: Lets users turn their real memories—such as a special day with a friend or a personal challenge overcome—into unique, on-chain NFTs. Minted on the Zircuit blockchain, these NFTs represent exclusive digital ownership of life’s authentic moments.
- **Scalability on Layer2**: All actions will take place on Layer2, providing low cost and high speed. In this way, the user experience will be smoothly executed.
- **Account Abstraction for gassless UX**: Enable gasless likes and interactions using Zircuit’s account abstraction tech.
- **Protection with Zircuit Quarantine Layer**: Automatically quarantine and cancel suspicious transactions (e.g., spam or theft attempts) using Zircuit’s SLS.
- **Monetization**: Allow users to bid on or donate to NFTs, fostering a creator economy.
- **Privacy with ZK-Proofs**: Use Zircuit’s zero-knowledge proofs to protect sensitive content while proving ownership.

## How It Works

![diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44ebd01-8326-4fe7-9d3c-1d82653852ca)


### 1. Minting an NFT
-A user shares a real memory (e.g., "My first hike with a friend" or "Overcoming a tough day") through a simple interface.
-The memory is minted as a unique NFT on the Zircuit blockchain, linked to the creator’s wallet.
-Example: nft.mint("My first hike with a friend", creatorAddress).


### 2. Account Abstraction
-Users can like or interact with memory NFTs without paying gas fees, thanks to Zircuit’s account abstraction.
-Transactions are batched, keeping costs low for everyone.


### 3. Quarantine Mechanism
-Suspicious transactions (e.g., rapid minting or unauthorized access) are handled by Zircuit’s sequencer.
-Proof that it’s not the same person is required to confirm ownership and cancel the transaction.


### 4. Monetization & Collaboration
-Users can interact with each other's memory NFTs (e.g., "Offer 0.1 ETH for a special memory") and donate support the creator.
-Creators and co-creators (e.g., the friend in the memory) share the proceeds.

Most Supported Content: Content that garners the most support from the community (such as likes, shares, or upvotes) will be rewarded to motivate creators to produce valuable content.
Most Read Content: Content that attracts the highest number of readers or viewers will be rewarded, encouraging the creation of engaging and relevant content.
Most Liked Content: Content that receives the most likes or positive feedback will be incentivized to drive high-quality contributions.
Longest Engagement: Users who spend the most time actively engaging with the app will be rewarded, fostering long-term usage and commitment to the platform.
Z-Memo Governance Model: Voting Power Based on Token Holding Duration and Quantity
On the Z-Memo platform, the voting rights of token holders are determined not only by the number of tokens they hold but also by how long they have been holding these tokens (hodling). This model aims to encourage greater commitment and participation in the platform's governance processes.

**Voting Power Calculation**
The voting power of token holders will be calculated based on the following two main factors:
Token Quantity:
Each token provides one vote. This allows the voting power of users to increase proportionally based on the number of tokens they hold.
For example, if a user holds 1000 tokens, they will have 1000 voting power.

**Token Holding Duration:**
Users who hold their tokens for a longer period will earn additional voting power based on the holding duration. This is a reward system designed to incentivize commitment to the platform.
The holding duration will grant users additional voting power in a compound manner, based on how long they hold their tokens (for example, a 5% increase every 30 days). This increase will be calculated compounded, meaning each period's additional power will be added to the previous total before applying the next increase.
In this system, users who hold more tokens and for a longer period will have more voting power, while users who engage in short-term trading will have less voting power.

**Example Voting Power Calculation (Compound Increase)**
The voting power of a user can be calculated as follows:
Token Quantity: 1000 tokens (1000 voting power)
Token Holding Duration: Held for 120 days (5% compound increase every 30 days)
First period increase: 1000 * 5% = 50
Second period increase: (1000 + 50) * 5% = 52.5
Third period increase: (1050 + 52.5) * 5% = 55.125
Fourth period increase: (1102.5 + 55.125) * 5% = 57.8125
Total increase: 50 + 52.5 + 55.125 + 57.8125 = 215.4375
Total Voting Power: 1000 + 215.4375 = 1215.4375 voting power
This system encourages users on the Z-Memo platform to hold their tokens for a longer period, as the compound increase will significantly boost the voting power of those who hold their tokens for a longer time.
This structure ensures that users who hold their tokens for the long term have more influence, creating a governance system that is more robust compared to short-term traders.


**Our Revenue Model**
Our revenue model will be based on taking a 15% commission from the earnings users make through donations and NFT sales on the platform. This commission will be used to ensure the sustainability of the platform and to provide better services to our users. Users will pay a 15% commission on the income they generate from NFT sales or donation campaigns.
In the future, once our user base reaches our target goals, we plan to introduce subscription systems to create additional revenue streams. These subscription models will offer users different options for accessing our platform's services.
Our subscription plans will consist of two main options: ad-supported and ad-free subscriptions:
Ad-supported subscription: Users will enjoy the platform at a lower subscription fee, but with ads displayed during their usage.
Ad-free subscription: Users will pay a higher subscription fee for an uninterrupted, ad-free experience.
These subscription systems will be introduced to improve the user experience on our platform and diversify our revenue streams as we move forward.
